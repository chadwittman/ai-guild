# What's this?
It's a podcast akin to grabbing coffee with Creative AI researchers. The target audience is people working within the tech industry.  

The focus will be on the [Creative AI](http://www.creativeai.net/) space. 

### Episodes

### Why are we doing this?
Our mission is to bring an open &amp; collaborative AI to all of humanity. 

Obsessed with consuming the latest Creative AI research, we found ourselves stuck between two types output from the nascent industry: PhD level research or BuzzFeed level simplification. This is our attempt to deliver a hybrid solution that is consumable by people that can use &amp; contribute.
